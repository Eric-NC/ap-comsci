// EXERCISE 1

/*
Youâ€™ve been hired to create a software system for the Awesome Animal Clinic! They would like to keep track of their animal patients. Here are some attributes of the pets that they would like to track:

- Name
- Age
- Weight
- Type (dog, cat, lizard, etc.)
- Breed

1. Create a class that keeps track of the attributes above for pet records at the animal clinic. Decide what instance variables are needed and their data types. Make sure you use int, double, and String data types. Make the instance variables private.
2. Create 2 constructors, one with no parameters and one with many parameters to initialize all the instance variables.
3. Create Accessor (get) methods for each of the instance variables.
4. Create a toString() method that returns all the information in a pet record.
5. In the main method below, create 3 pet objects and call their constructors, accessor methods, and toString methods to test all of your methods.
6. Make sure you use good commenting!
*/

// EXERCISE 2

/*
Copy your Awesome Animal Clinic Pet class from the last exercise.

Add set methods for each of the 5 instance variables. Make sure you use good commenting!

Test each of the set methods in the main method.
