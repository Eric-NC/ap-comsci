/*
There are two objects moving in opposite direction over the same line, separated by 250 distance units.ï¿½ 
Write java code that ask the user for a integer number between 1 and 25 representing the collision speed of a object 
(repeat this question until the number meet the requirement), 
repeat the same procedure to ask the user for a second positive integer number representing the collision speed of a second object. 
When the two numbers meet the requirements, use a for loop to print, one per second and one per line, how many seconds remaining for collision between the two objects. 
A method to delay execution one second is provided. 
Do not considerate any acceleration effect. Use distance = speed * time as your main equation using integer division.

Sample run:

Enter a speed for the first object: 10
Enter a speed for the second object: 15
10 second to collision.
9 second to collision.
8 second to collision.
7 second to collision.
6 second to collision.
5 second to collision.
4 second to collision.
3 second to collision.
2 second to collision.
1 second to collision.
Objects collided
