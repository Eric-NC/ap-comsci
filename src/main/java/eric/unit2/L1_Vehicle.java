/*
 You have been hired to help a new car manufacturer that build compact cars, full size cars, pick-up truck, and minivans 
 to create a program that allow them to recordï¿½ the manufacturing year, model, engine size, color, type of fuel, and number 
 of seats for each vehicle they build. So you decided to create a java class named vehicle to accomplish this purpose. 
 Write the java class that meets these requirements.
 
Hint: At this point, there is no staring point or output for your code
