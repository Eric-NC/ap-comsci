 Write two methods to manipulate numbers.

The first method namedï¿½sum takes 3 double numbers and returns the sum of them.

The second methods named average returns the average of the same three numbers.

Sample run:

Introduce first number: 5.5

Introduce second number: 20.1

Introduce third number: 99.9

The sum of these numbers is 125.5

The average of this numbers is 41.8333333333
